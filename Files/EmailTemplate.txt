Hi Caleb,

My name is Aadarsh. I'm a software engineer at KPIT and a recent graduate from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. I really liked your channel, especially your recent video titled "Why the World Is Watching Indian Space Startups".

While scrolling through the comments, I was wondering how you manage them all. It sparked an idea for a small tool to help creators manage their comments. So, I built the first version of "Comment Copilot" (it's still in progress). It sorts your comments into actionable tasks in minutes, categorizing them into:

Reply to Question: To engage directly with your audience.
Appreciate Fan: To quickly find and thank your supporters.
Ideas: To discover suggestions for your next video.
Constructive Criticisms: To find valuable feedback for improvement.
Delete Junk: To instantly clear out spam and irrelevant noise.

Would a tool like this be helpful for you? If so, I'd be thrilled to set you up as one of the first testers, completely free of charge.

To show you exactly how it works, I've attached a short demo video and a few images of the interface.
(Platform is changing continuously, you may see some mismatch with the current state).

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
Best,
Aadarsh
